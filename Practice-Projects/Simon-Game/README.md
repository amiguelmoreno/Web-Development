<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main goal of this project is to learn:
 * Basics of **localStorage** property

### How does it work?

* Press the START button to play
* The game generate a random secuence and the user have to repeat the secuence of colors that light up
* This secence increases by 1 on each round that the user get the secuence correct. If the user fails, the secence is restarted to 1
* User can see the highscore and current score are displayed on the screen.
<br />
