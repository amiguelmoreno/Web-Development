<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The main goal of this project is to learn:
 * How to manage DOM events
 * About AddEventListener JS Method
 * Take values from inputs, use them to do operations and give back the correct information.
<br />

### How does it work?

* The app shows the current operation that your are doing and also the previous one
* It shows up to 3 decimal numbers
* Where you want to add some decimal number press the '.' button
<br />
 There are two ways to use the calculator:

   * By clicking the buttons on the screen
   * By pressing the keypad buttons of your keyboard
  
     * "Backspace" button to delete one number each time it is pressed
     * "Delete" button to delete all
<br />

### What did I used to get the best of this project?

  * Best Practices:
    * BEM method to name classes in CSS and HTML  
    * Keep It Organized
    * Make It Understandable
  
  * <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-SASS-ff69b4" alt="Logo"> as a CSS pre-processor. Which offer:
    * Efficient syntax
    * Readable styles files
